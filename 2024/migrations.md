# Underlined
* The midnight sun has turned the world indigo and something about the quality of the light reminds me of the land where I was raised, that special Galway blue. I’ve seen a fair helping of the world and what strikes me most is that there are no two qualities of light the same, no matter where you go.
* Mam used to tell me to look for the clues. “The clues to what?” I asked the first time. “To life. They’re hidden everywhere.”
* “There is pleasure in the pathless woods. There is rapture on the lonely shore. There is society where none intrudes, by the deep sea, and music in its roar.”
* There are very few people, in my understanding of the world, who offer tenderness so freely.
* “How will you get back?” Megan asks. “Back to where?” “Galway. Your life. Isn’t that where it is?” I don’t know the answer to that. I had thought my life was just here, with me.
* A nameless sadness, the fading away of the birds. The fading away of the animals. How lonely it will be here, when it’s just us.
* Even though they are as varied as a group of people can be, I can tell they are the same, all of these sailors. Something was missing in their lives on land, and they went seeking the answer.
* My life has been a migration without a destination, and that in itself is senseless. I leave for no reason, just to be moving, and it breaks my heart a thousand times, a million. It’s a relief to at last have a purpose. I wonder what it will feel like to stop. I wonder where we go, afterward, and if we are followed. I suspect we go nowhere, and become nothing, and the only thing that saddens me about this is the idea of never seeing Niall again. We are, all of us, given such a brief moment of time together, it hardly seems fair. But it’s precious, and maybe it’s enough, and maybe it’s right that our bodies dissolve into the earth, giving our energy back to it, feeding the little creatures in the ground and giving nutrients to the soil, and maybe it’s right that our consciousness rests.
* A life’s impact can be measured by what it gives and what it leaves behind, but it can also be measured by what it steals from the world.
* “Like a shipwreck we die going into ourselves…”
* “The stronger you are, the more dangerous the world.”
* All these humans have left no space for anything else.
* Because it seems to me, suddenly, that if it’s the end, really and truly, if you’re making the last migration not just of your life but of your entire species, you don’t stop sooner. Even when you’re tired and starved and hopeless. You go farther.
